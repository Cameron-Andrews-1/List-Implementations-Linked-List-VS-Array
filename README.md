# List-Implementations-Linked-List-VS-Array
Includes full implementations of sorted linked list and array list classes.                                                          
Tests performance of both list implementations using large text file of random words as input.                                                   
Records times for:
  1. Inserting all words
  2. Finding each word
  3. Removing all words
